# p1st
A program I wrote, thinking about people 1st

While not neccessarily useful, this program demonstrates what my first high level language can do! It also tells something about people 1st, and gets them thinking about people first of washington. It also shows what I can do, using my own language, and simple subroutines. I've been practicing to get this good, without looking at my manuals, that is.

One can compile it, by downloading the PNF suite of tools, and when set up, do the following:

* pnfha p1st.pha p1st.pasm
* pnfasm p1st.pasm p1st.pnf

Then run it with:

* pnf p1st.pnf

Or, compile it to c++ with:

* pnf2cpp p1st.pnf p1st.cpp

Then, install g++, and compile with that, as follows:

* g++ p1st.cpp -o p1st.exe

No .exe on linux!

Then, run with:

* p1st

DISCLAIMER: This was NOT done with people 1st's payroll, or approval. While I'm certain they would not disagree, or think badly of it, I just did it for fun when I was not in a meeting. I was thinking of them, and what the whole group believes, and wanted to have some fun, and practice with my own language. If you have problems, come to me first. While I am a part of it (member), I don't make up the whole group.
